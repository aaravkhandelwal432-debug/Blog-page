                <summary>Our philsophy</summary>
                <p>We believe "If the foundation is strong; the building is bound to be strong". This holds true in
                    terms of early childhood development as well.

                    With apt resources, time and effort, we wish to create an ideal childhood paved with smiles and
                    laughter.

                    We admire the innocence children have. We wish to create a new world for our children. A world that
                    allows them to explore the beauty and experience the joy around them, while providing them comfort
                    and warmth. By combining both ideals of nature and nurture, we wish to create an empty Canvas for
                    kids to fill in with their wonderful imagination. We believe this self-expression will mould their
                    identity. By encouraging our children to be creative by singing, dancing and playing, we open their
                    minds to a world of possibilities and hope for their succe</p>

            <p><b>Machine learning<b> is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing models and
                        algorithms that let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every
                        task. In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning
